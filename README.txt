just as a heads up, I am still extremely new to Python
this probably isn't the best code nor is it pretty, but it's functional?
(I coded this in VS Code on Windows, please laugh)

Instructions:

*** make sure the fpdf library is included in Python ***
*** pip install fpdf ***

- download .csv file from learn 
  (search by "Manage Users" and enter class ID in search bar)
- rename .csv to class ID 
  (make sure to be consistant with upper/lowercase, haven't "idiot proofed" it yet)
- make sure .csv is in the same folder as script
- run the script
- enter the class ID in the console
- file generates a PDF of the class roster with first/last name and username
